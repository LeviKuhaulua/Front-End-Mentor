## My process

### Built with

- Desktop-First Approach 
- HTML Semantic Elements 
- CSS Grid
- CSS classes & pseudo-classes

### What I learned

Something that I learned was the `min` function in CSS that I used to help make the card responsive to smaller screensizes. See code below: 

```css
.card {
  ... code before hand 
  
  max-width: min(30ch, 80% + 1em); /* width will be the minimum of the two */ 
  
  ... code after
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue using the `min` function and other functions in CSS such as `max` to help make elements more responsive without needing to use something such as a media query.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - min() function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min) - documentation regarding the min function and how it works.
