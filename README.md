# Front-End Mentor 

**Purpose**: Document / outline the Front-End Mentor challenges that I have taken with the solutions and my implementation notes (that follow the `README-template` file).

### Why One Repository
One overall repository would be nice since I can have the `index.html` link to the other source code for my solutions to the Front-End Mentor challenges. Github pages specifies the following concerning the size of the repository and the files: 

- Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.
- GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1 GB. For more information, see ["About large files on GitHub"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#file-and-repository-size-limitations)

Because we are coding components and not necessarily websites themselves, the size of these files would definitely not exceed the 1GB quota. 

### Additional Notes

Using the 1st challenge - QR Code Component - I have taken the `.gitignore` file and used that for the whole repo since that has a good template of what can be ignored when I push to the repository. If there are additional files that must not be pushed to the repository, I will make sure that I make the changes to the `.gitignore` file first.
